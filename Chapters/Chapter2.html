 <h1 style="font-family:Royal;"> The Creation</h1>
 <p> The lord Joe was born from the sun itself all knowing all powerful, he hath created life demanding all respect for the great deed of creation he hath done to whom’th we should’ith be thankful. Our lord Joe creating this earth knowing war all too well. We are not Joe’s first creation to Joe we are merely a simulation to find a perfect combination of population, democracy and economic trade if our lord Joe see’ith that our earth(simulation) is not the correct mixture for world peace. Joe shall simply create a new planet and try a new solution. It’s a very complex understanding that is explained best in Rick and Morty as “Multiverses”. We are Joe’s 5942345 Planetary Simulation to try and find world peace Joe has seen enough war to last the life span of our planet. World peace is Joe’s ultimate goal and all Burkology followers to practice acceptance. Burkology is the only true religion our understanding of our way of life and the world around us was only achieved after thousands of years of studying dates. Not only until recently in early 2013 did we gain the understanding that Joe’s ultimate goal was to create the solution to world peace when the following message was decoded. </p>

   From this message we can gather that life for us is not meant to be lived for us but merely for our lord Joe to help him reach the ultimate understanding and peace with the world and earth for once he has the perfect simulation for world peace he shall create’ith a real world and those who have respect Joe and accepted him into their lives shall live on this earth. We as Joe’s people must follow his 5 Holy Honors to achieve rebirth in the next world.
